# Calculator

ConsoleApplication3 functions as a calculator. This calculator implements the following mathematical functions:

a)Addition b)Subtraction c)Multiplication d)Division e)Minimum f) Maximum g)Cosinus/Sinus h)Basic Derivation

ConsoleApplication3 references the assembly called 'ClassLibrary1.dll
All new mathematical functions should be added to this library class and inherit from the interface Computer.

              ===== Welcome to Calculator 3.1 =====
			  
Attention: This calculator does not implement the rules of BODMAS

			===== Rules for usage: ====

Calculator 3.1 strictly uses the following formula to evaluate equations:
'Operation' [SPACE key] 'First number' [SPACE key] 'Second number' where 'Operation' can either be:

a) Divider b) Multiplier c) Adder d) Subtractor e) Minimum f) Maximum g)Cosinus/Sinus h)Derivation

Calculator 3.1 does not evaluate any unknown commands! Program will restart.
Example --> Command:
            Divider 10 5 
Important: Respect the order of division when dividing --> 
			'First number' / 'Second number'
The structure for Derive is as follows -->
			" Derive [SPACE key] 'Coeffecient of x' [SPACE key] 'x^Exponenent'
The parameters 'First number' and 'Second number' are real numbers.
The operations 'Minimum' and 'Maximum' only accept whole numbers (integers) 
All operations take a maximum of 10 values at a time to ease visualization
Enter 'Help'to retrieve the diferent types in referenced Assembly
Enter 'Exit'or 'exit' to close calculator

That's it, happy calculating.
